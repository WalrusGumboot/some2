# SoME no. 2: how elliptic curves secure our data

Let's say you've been out with some friends and one of you has paid the entire
bill. You insist on paying back your share of the evening's entertainment, and
so you open your banking app of choice, enter the amount and within seconds, the
money is transferred from your account to your friend's. The day after, you wake
up and (because of your crippling social media addiction) you open Twitter.
Immediately, you get a whole feed full of tweets for you to enjoy. Maybe you
encounter a tweet about Bitcoin or Ethereum, and maybe you've wondered how those
actually work. Surprisingly, the underlying principle of Bitcoin is the same as
that of Twitter and your bank transactions. Their secret lies in a special kind
of curve, called an *elliptic curve*. Let's explore the details behind these
fascinating objects, and how we give rise to new worlds using mathematics itself.

## part 1: what is an elliptic curve?

Imagine you're back in high school. You've just learned about these things
called polynomials, and your English teacher is rambling on and on about iambic
pentameter or something. So, being bored out of your mind, you grab your graphic
calculator and start playing around.

## part 2: how can we shape new maths? (the group law)

## part 3: okay, that's... cool, but how is it useful?
